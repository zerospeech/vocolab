## Environment & Configuration

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment :

1. python 3.7+

2. An instance of [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com) installed.


### Configuration

To configure your environment a .env file is used. you need to specify an 
environment variable named `ZR_ENV_FILE` configured, so the module knows were 
load variables from.

For an example on the minimum setup see [example.env](example.env)

More information on settings and the meaning of each parameter can be found [here](docs/settings.md)

> If some variables are not set correctly it might affect some features of the module as they are a hard dependency.
